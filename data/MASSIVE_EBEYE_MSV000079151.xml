      <name>GNPS LCMS data from oral isolates during in vitro metabolism of sugar and lactate</name>
      <description>Several oral bacterial species were grown anaerobically and fed either glucose or lactate in SHI medium (for method see: Edlund et al., 2013, Edlund et al, 2015 - see http://www.microbiomejournal.com/content/pdf/2049-2618-1-25.pdf   &amp;   http://www.nature.com/ismej/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ismej201572a.html). Biofilm samples for LCMS were collected at different time points from growth wells. After growth was established in SHI medium, biofilms were washed with minimal medium and supplemented with either glucose or lactate (Veillonella species) (see Edlund et al., 2013, Edlund et al., 2015). Samples were collected both after the initial biofilm establishment in SHI medium and after the addition of the supplemented cdm medium. According to gnps network analyses and data sorting exercises: 1) ~10% of this data is reproducible; 2) several of the present masses can also be detected both in SHI and cdm medium. mzXML files for media is not uploaded here (i.e. no media subtraction can be employed using these files only). </description>
