      <description>This submission is part of the mass spectrometry datasets for the manuscript by Lambert et al. that describes the use of SWATH to rapidly monitor differential interactomes. This submission contains 27 SWATH files and 9 IDA files for the following baits: CDK4 WT, CDK4 R24C and CDK4 R24H.  Three biological replicates for each bait were analyzed by both IDA and SWATH; additionally, two technical replicates for each of the biological replicates were analyzed by SWATH.  See the README file within "Methods and Protocols" and the accompanying File description.  Additional details and files are found on prohits-web.lunenfeld.ca. </description>
