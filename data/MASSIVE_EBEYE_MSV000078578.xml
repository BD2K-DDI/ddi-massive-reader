      <name>glucose amendment of Streptococcus mutans biofilm </name>
      <description>In this experiment we collected small molecule data that represent excreted molecules by Streptococcus mutans growing as a biofilm.  The S. mutans biofilms were established and incubated in anaerobic conditions. Samples were collected before and after a drastic pH drop due to glucose amendments. Control samples are included in this folder that represent molecules that were extracted from sterilized growth media only. These peaks should be subtracted from the biofilm samples prior to analyses. </description>
